Building on the good work by Kohsuke for one shot execution of Jenkinsfiles. 
This shows how to run Jenkinsfiles on Codeship Pro. 

The image used was published using the instructions on https://github.com/kohsuke/jenkinsfile-runner/
(you can customise the build either by tweaking the Dockerfile here, or building your own image).
